Analysis of `app.py` against Financial Planning Framework

This document outlines the implemented features, missing modules, and suggestions for improvement for the `app.py` Streamlit application, based on the "Comprehensive Financial Planning Framework (2025) (MFD version) - Part 1 & 2".

**I. Implemented Features (Current State of `app.py`)**

*   **Core Application Structure:**
    *   Streamlit application with basic UI and custom CSS.
    *   SQLite database (`financial_planning.db`) for storing investor and basic economic data.
    *   Fernet encryption for sensitive data.
*   **Investor Input & Basic Profiling:**
    *   Investor data collection form (personal, financial, dependents, housing, emergency fund, investment experience).
    *   Risk assessment questionnaire.
    *   Investor ID generation.
    *   Basic age calculation.
    *   Simplified risk score calculation and rating (0-100 scale).
    *   A very basic `assign_profile` function (currently assigns "B1" to "B7", not aligned with the framework's 30 profiles).
*   **Dashboard Placeholders:**
    *   Navigation for "Investor Input", "Investor Dashboard", "MFD Dashboard", "Economic Dashboard", "Risk Profile".
    *   Investor search functionality.
*   **Data Handling:**
    *   Encryption and decryption functions for financial details.
    *   Mock economic data loading.
    *   Placeholder for Google Sheets integration.

**II. Key Missing Modules and Features (Gap Analysis)**

The application currently implements foundational elements but lacks many of the sophisticated features and detailed logic outlined in the comprehensive framework.

    *   **Missing:**
        *   Implementation of the 30 detailed Investor Profiles (W1-W15, B1-B15) with specific income ranges, life cycle stages, and financial contexts. The current `assign_profile` is a placeholder.
        *   Detailed Income Level Methodology (Framework Part 1, Sec 4).
        *   Progressive onboarding for the investor form.
        *   Enhanced AI error detection for input validation (e.g., income vs. profile mismatch).
        *   Storage of `financial_history`, `financial_metrics`, `profile_history`, `validation_results` as per the JSON schema.
        *   Predictive signals for AI-driven life event forecasting.
        *   Detailed dependent deduction logic for savings calculation.
*   **2. Risk Tolerance Assessment (Framework Part 1, Sec 11):**
    *   **Missing:**
        *   AI integration for validating risk assessment.
        *   Dynamic Risk Scoring based on changing investor data or market conditions.
        *   Stress testing scenarios.
        *   Historical risk score tracking.
        *   The framework (Part 1, Sec 5.1) mentions risk scores 5-10 (Risk-Averse), 11-15 (Moderate), 16-25 (Aggressive) for an initial assessment, which needs reconciliation with the app's 0-100 scale and the comprehensive assessment in Sec 11.
*   **3. Financial Goals and Prioritization (Framework Part 1, Sec 6, 7):**
    *   **Missing:**
        *   Natural Language Processing (NLP) for goal input.
        *   AI-driven goal adjustments based on economic updates or investor profile changes.
        *   Detailed savings capacity and allocation logic (Household Income, Dependent Deduction, Disposable Income, Savings Rate application as per Section 8).
        *   SIP calculation with best-case, base-case, worst-case scenarios using the FV formula.
        *   Specific investment product selection logic based on goals, risk, and economic conditions (e.g., value, dividend yield, contra funds).
        *   Implementation of specific financial goal types with their parameters and adjustments (Education, Home Purchase, etc.).
*   **4. Savings and Adjustments (Framework Part 1, Sec 8, 9):**
    *   **Missing:**
        *   Recommended Savings Rates slab structure (Blue-Collar/White-Collar) and modifiers.
        *   Annual Savings Adjustment Rates (base and fallback).
*   **5. Economic Update and Dashboards (Framework Part 2, Sec 19; App pages):**
    *   **Missing:**
        *   **Economic Update Module:** Real-time data collection for specified economic indicators (GDP, IIP, CPI, etc.) from sources like MOSPI, RBI APIs; storage of historical economic data; AI-driven trend analysis.
        *   **Economic Dashboard for MFDs:** Display of current indicators, trend graphs, AI forecasts; early warning notifications; functionality for MFDs to apply dynamic plan adjustments.
        *   **Investor Dashboard:** Content such as profile summary, financial metrics, goals progress, investment recommendations, economic insights, visuals.
        *   **MFD Dashboard:** Full functionality including investor selection panel, detailed plan management, action items, and audit logs.
*   **6. Plan Management and Health Checks (Framework Part 1, Sec 14, 15, 16):**
    *   **Missing:** Plan Lock Mechanism, Feasibility Analysis module, Annual Health Checks.
*   **7. Communication and Reporting (Framework Part 2, Sec 18, 20, 21, 22):**
    *   **Missing:** Multilingual support, AI-driven translations, multiple delivery channels for notifications; Investor Guide generation; comprehensive MFD Guide interface; standardized Investor Report Structure.

*   **10. App Integration and Error Handling (Framework Part 1, Sec 5.4, 17):**
    *   **Missing:** Advanced real-time validation, scenario analysis tool, enhanced AI-driven error handling.

**III. Suggestions for Improvement (Existing Code)**

*   **1. Investor Profiling (`assign_profile` function):**
    *   **Action:** Refactor to implement the 30 profiles (W1-W15, B1-B15) based on occupation, age, income (using framework's methodology), and dependents. Refer to Framework Part 1, Section 3 & 4.
*   **2. Risk Score Calculation (`calculate_risk_score` function):**
    *   **Action:** Revise to align with Framework Part 1, Sec 11, incorporating its multi-faceted approach and ensuring score bands match the framework's definitions.
*   **3. Database Schema (`init_db` function):**
    *   **Action:** Plan for migration to PostgreSQL. For now, expand SQLite schema to include more fields from the framework (e.g., `plan_in_action_date`, `consent_log`, `market_linked_experience`) and prepare for new tables.
*   **4. Encryption (`encrypt_data`, `decrypt_data`):**
    *   **Action:** Ensure robust key management for `KEY_FILE`.
*   **5. Investor Input Form (Streamlit UI):**
    *   **Action:** Enhance input validations (regex for mobile/email, logical dates). Consider progressive onboarding (Framework Part 1, Sec 5.1).
*   **6. Google Sheets Integration (`fetch_google_form_data`):**
    *   **Action:** Implement OAuth2 flow and gspread API calls. Securely manage credentials.
