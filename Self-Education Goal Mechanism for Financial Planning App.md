# Self-Education Goal Mechanism for Financial Planning App

## Purpose
This document outlines a mechanism for Mutual Fund Distributors (MFDs) using the financial planning app to include self-education expenses as a financial goal for young investors (aged 22–28, Young Adult life cycle stage, profiles W1–W3, B1–B3). It extends the app’s logic to support manual input of self-education goals, calculate target amounts and timelines, and integrate with existing goal prioritization and savings allocation frameworks.

## Scope
- **Target Audience**: Young Adult investors (aged 22–28, profiles W1–W3 for White-Collar, B1–B3 for Blue-Collar) who wish to fund their own higher education (e.g., postgraduate studies, professional certifications).
- **Integration**: Aligns with existing master documents, including:
  - `Investor_Profiles_Master_Updated.markdown` (profile definitions)
  - `Master Document: Mutual Fund Investment Options Based on Goals` (investment options)
  - `Master Document: Indicative Returns of Mutual Fund Schemes` (returns data)
  - `Application Logic Documentation for Financial Planning.md` (core logic)
  - `Master for Annual Savings Adjustment Rates_Updated.markdown` (savings rates)
- **Constraints**: Self-education is not currently in the `Investor Profile and Risk Assessment Form` (artifact ID: `94a08765-01b9-4a51-a160-68d1a21591f6`). The mechanism relies on MFD manual input and must not disrupt existing goals (debt reduction, emergency fund, kids’ education, home purchase, marriage, retirement).

## Mechanism Overview
The mechanism allows MFDs to:
1. Input a self-education goal via a new app interface field for eligible investors.
2. Specify the target year, estimated cost, and priority relative to other goals.
3. Integrate the goal into the app’s savings allocation and investment planning logic.
4. Generate updated reports (e.g., Investor Guide, Year-Wise Investment Objectives) reflecting the self-education goal.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Eligibility Check
- **Criteria**: Investor must be in the Young Adult life cycle stage (aged 22–28 as of 09/05/2025, calculated from DOB in the Investor Profile Form).
- **Profiles**: W1–W3 (White-Collar, Low/Sufficient/Good income), B1–B3 (Blue-Collar, Low/Sufficient/Good income).
- **Logic**: The app checks the investor’s age and profile ID during data entry. If eligible, a “Self-Education Goal” option is enabled in the MFD interface.

### 2. MFD Input Interface
- **New Field in App**:
  - **Field Name**: Self-Education Goal
  - **Inputs**:
    - **Enable Goal**: Checkbox to include self-education (default: unchecked).
    - **Target Year**: Numeric input (e.g., 2028, must be ≥ current year + 1).
    - **Estimated Cost**: Numeric input (₹, e.g., 3,00,000 for a postgraduate degree).
    - **Priority**: Dropdown (High, Medium, Low) to rank against other goals.
  - **Validation**:
    - Target year must be realistic (e.g., 1–10 years from 2025, i.e., 2026–2035).
    - Estimated cost must be positive and reasonable (e.g., ₹50,000–₹10,00,000, based on typical higher education costs in India).
    - Priority influences allocation but defaults to Medium if not specified.
- **UI Placement**: Add to the “Financial Goals” section of the MFD dashboard, below existing goals (e.g., Debt Reduction, Emergency Fund).

### 3. Target Amount and Timeline
- **Default Target Amounts** (based on typical Indian higher education costs, 2025):
  - **White-Collar (W1–W3)**:
    - Postgraduate Degree (e.g., MBA, M.Tech): ₹3,00,000–₹7,00,000
    - Professional Certification (e.g., CFA, CA): ₹1,00,000–₹3,00,000
  - **Blue-Collar (B1–B3)**:
    - Vocational Training (e.g., ITI, diploma): ₹50,000–₹2,00,000
    - Part-Time Degree/Certification: ₹1,00,000–₹3,00,000
- **Inflation Adjustment**: Apply a 5% annual inflation rate to the estimated cost from 2025 to the target year.
  - Formula: Adjusted Cost = Estimated Cost × (1 + 0.05)^(Target Year – 2025)
  - Example: ₹3,00,000 in 2025 for a 2028 goal → ₹3,00,000 × 1.05^3 = ₹3,47,287 (rounded to ₹3,47,300).
- **Timeline**:
  - Default: 3–7 years (2028–2032 for 2025), adjustable by MFD.
  - Short-term (1–3 years) for certifications, medium-term (3–7 years) for degrees.

### 4. Goal Prioritization Logic (Update to `Application Logic Documentation for Financial Planning.md`)
- **Integration with Existing Logic**:
  - Self-Education is added to the goal prioritization hierarchy in Section 3 of `Application Logic Documentation for Financial Planning.md`.
  - Updated hierarchy (from highest to lowest priority):
    1. Debt Reduction (if Loan-to-Income Ratio > 20%)
    2. Emergency Fund
    3. Self-Education (if High priority or timeline < 3 years)
    4. Short-Term Essential Goals (e.g., kids’ education due soon)
    5. Medium-Term Goals (e.g., home purchase, kids’ education)
    6. Long-Term Goals (e.g., retirement, marriage)
- **Priority Adjustment**:
  - **High Priority**: Self-Education ranks after Emergency Fund, before other short-term goals.
  - **Medium Priority**: Ranks with medium-term goals.
  - **Low Priority**: Ranks with long-term goals.
  - If timeline < 3 years, elevate to High priority automatically to ensure feasibility.
- **Minimum Allocation Rule** (extends Section 4.5 of `Application Logic Documentation`):
  - **White-Collar**: Allocate at least ₹500/month or 10% of ideal monthly savings for self-education, whichever is lower, if savings are constrained.
  - **Blue-Collar**: Allocate at least ₹200/month or 10% of ideal monthly savings, whichever is lower.
  - If insufficient savings, scale down higher-priority goals (e.g., Debt Reduction) to accommodate, extending their timelines if needed.

### 5. Savings Allocation
- **Monthly Savings Calculation**:
  - Use the future value formula to determine monthly savings needed:
    - FV = Adjusted Cost (from inflation adjustment)
    - r = Expected annual return (from `Master Document: Indicative Returns of Mutual Fund Schemes`)
    - n = Number of years (Target Year – Current Year)
    - m = 12 (monthly compounding)
    - Monthly Savings = FV × (r/m) / [(1 + r/m)^(n×m) – 1]
  - Example: ₹3,47,300 in 2028 (3 years), 7.7% return (Debt-Oriented Hybrid Fund):
    - r = 0.077, n = 3, m = 12
    - Monthly Savings = ₹3,47,300 × (0.077/12) / [(1 + 0.077/12)^(3×12) – 1] ≈ ₹8,600
- **Savings Rate Adjustment**:
  - Apply the base savings rate from `Master for Annual Savings Adjustment Rates_Updated.markdown` (e.g., 7–9% for W1–W3, 3–5% for B1–B3).
  - Adjust for modifiers (e.g., +1% for home ownership, +0.5% for no loans).
  - If self-education increases total savings rate beyond capacity, scale down lower-priority goals or extend timelines, as per Section 4.5 of `Application Logic Documentation`.

### 6. Investment Product Selection
- **Fund Selection** (aligned with `Master Document: Mutual Fund Investment Options Based on Goals`):
  - **Timeline < 3 years**: Debt Funds (e.g., Ultra Short Duration, Low Duration, 6% return).
  - **Timeline 3–7 years**: Debt-Oriented Hybrid Funds or Large Cap Equity Funds (7.7–9.9% return).
  - **Risk Profile Adjustment**:
    - Risk-Averse: Prioritize Debt Funds or Conservative Hybrid Funds.
    - Moderate: Balance Debt-Oriented Hybrid and Large Cap Equity Funds.
    - Aggressive: Include some Multi Cap Funds for higher returns if timeline ≥ 5 years.
- **Example Allocation**:
  - W2 investor, 3-year timeline, Moderate risk: 60% Debt-Oriented Hybrid Fund (7.7%), 40% Large Cap Equity Fund (9.9%).
  - B1 investor, 2-year timeline, Risk-Averse: 100% Ultra Short Duration Fund (6%).

### 7. Report Integration
- **Updated Reports**:
  - **Investor Guide** (e.g., `Investor Guide.markdown`): Add Self-Education to the goals table, savings schedule, and growth projections, similar to kids’ education.
  - **Year-Wise Investment Objectives** (artifact ID: `762c4d72-5c98-4adf-8f77-f045f6533d7b`): Include self-education in yearly savings and investment plans.
  - **Goal Comparison Document**: Reflect self-education as a suggested goal, noting any timeline extensions for other goals if savings are constrained.
- **AI Insights** (from `Use of AI by the App.markdown`):
  - Prompt example: “For a 25-year-old W2 investor with ₹40,000 income, adding a ₹3,00,000 self-education goal in 2028, suggest risks or opportunities.”
  - Output: “The investor’s stable income supports the self-education goal, but high debt may require prioritizing debt reduction to free up savings.”

### 8. Technical Implementation
- **App Update**:
  - Add a new database field in the Investor Profile schema:
    ```json
    {
      "self_education_goal": {
        "enabled": false,
        "target_year": null,
        "estimated_cost": null,
        "priority": "Medium"
      }
    }
    ```
  - Update the MFD dashboard UI to include the Self-Education Goal input fields.
- **Logic Update**:
  - Modify the goal prioritization function (Section 3 of `Application Logic Documentation`) to include self-education based on priority and timeline.
  - Extend the savings allocation function (Section 4) to calculate monthly savings for self-education using the future value formula.
- **API Integration**:
  - Update the Hugging Face API prompt (artifact ID: `b2e5f8c0-5d3f-4b7e-a1c4-3f9d2e7c6a0b`) to include self-education data for AI insights.
  - Example: Add `self_education_goal` to the input data sent to the API.

### 9. Example Scenario
- **Investor**: 25-year-old, W2 (White-Collar, Sufficient income, ₹40,000/month), Moderate risk, no dependents, no loans.
- **Self-Education Goal**: ₹3,00,000 for an MBA in 2028 (3 years).
- **Calculation**:
  - Adjusted Cost: ₹3,00,000 × 1.05^3 = ₹3,47,300
  - Monthly Savings: ₹8,600 (7.7% return, Debt-Oriented Hybrid Fund)
- **Savings Allocation**:
  - Base Savings Rate: 8% (from `Master for Annual Savings Adjustment Rates_Updated`)
  - Total Monthly Savings: ₹40,000 × 8% = ₹3,200
  - Goals: Emergency Fund (₹1,000/month), Self-Education (₹2,200/month, scaled down from ₹8,600 due to savings constraint, extending timeline to 4 years).
- **Report Output** (Investor Guide excerpt):
  | Goal           | Target Year | Target Amount (₹) | Monthly Savings (₹) |
  |----------------|-------------|-------------------|---------------------|
  | Emergency Fund | 2030        | 1,20,000          | 1,000               |
  | Self-Education | 2029        | 3,47,300          | 2,200               |

### 10. Guidelines
- **Consistency**: Ensure self-education aligns with kids’ education frameworks (e.g., similar investment options, inflation adjustments).
- **Validation**: Cross-check savings feasibility with disposable income and other goals, scaling down as needed.
- **Privacy**: Anonymize investor data for AI processing, as per `Use of AI by the App.markdown`.
- **Review**: Annually review target amounts and returns with `Master Document: Indicative Returns of Mutual Fund Schemes`.
