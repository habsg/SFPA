# Recommended Savings Rates Master for Investors (Updated for 30 Investor Profiles)

This master provides a tiered structure for recommended savings rates for all 30 White-Collar and Blue-Collar investor profiles, reflecting the principle that savings capacity increases disproportionately as income rises. Savings rates are defined with a base rate up to a threshold (covering unavoidable expenses) and a higher rate for income above that threshold, tailored to each profile’s life cycle stage, income level (as defined in `Investor_Profiles_Master_Updated.markdown` and `income_level_master_2025.md`), and sufficiency. Monthly savings figures are rounded: to the nearest ₹100 if less than ₹4,000, and to the nearest ₹500 if ₹4,000 or more. Modifiers adjust rates based on home ownership, borrowing status, dependents’ goal completion, and spouse’s income.

## Savings Rate Modifiers
Adjust savings rates based on the following conditions (cumulative):
- **Home Ownership = Yes and Not Paying Rent**: +5% to both base and above-threshold rates.
- **No Loans (Monthly Loan Repayment = 0)**: +3% to both rates.
- **Education/Marriage Goals Completed** (per dependent, e.g., daughter’s DOB 10/05/2000 → Age 25 as of 08/05/2025, education funded): +2% to both rates.
- **Spouse Income (Spouse-to-Investor Income Ratio)**:
  - **White-Collar**:
    - Ratio < 20%: +1% to both rates.
    - Ratio 20%–50%: +3% to both rates.
    - Ratio > 50%: +5% to both rates.
  - **Blue-Collar**:
    - Ratio < 20%: +0.5% to both rates.
    - Ratio 20%–50%: +1% to both rates.
    - Ratio > 50%: +2% to both rates.

### Example for Pre-Retirement, Low Income (Profile W10, Income ₹80,000)
- **Baseline (W10)**: Threshold ₹60,000, Base Rate 12%, Above-Threshold Rate 20%.
  - Savings: (₹60,000 × 12%) + (₹20,000 × 20%) = ₹7,200 + ₹4,000 = ₹11,200 → ₹11,000.
- **With Modifiers** (Home Ownership = Yes, No Rent, No Loans, Daughter’s Education Completed, Spouse Income ₹50,000):
  - Daughter’s DOB: 10/05/2000 → Age = 2025 - 2000 = 25 years (as of 08/05/2025), education completed.
  - Spouse-to-Investor Income Ratio: ₹50,000 / ₹80,000 = 62.5% → +5% (White-Collar).
  - Total Modifiers: +5% (Home Ownership) + 3% (No Loans) + 2% (Education Completed) + 5% (Spouse Income) = +15%.
  - Adjusted Base Rate: 12% + 15% = 27%.
  - Adjusted Above-Threshold Rate: 20% + 15% = 35%.
  - Adjusted Savings: (₹60,000 × 27%) + (₹20,000 × 35%) = ₹16,200 + ₹7,000 = ₹23,200 → ₹23,000 (rounded to nearest ₹500).

## Implementation Notes
- **Dynamic Application**: Derive the investor’s age from DOB (dd/mm/yyyy format) as of 08/05/2025. Derive dependents’ ages from their DOBs as of 08/05/2025 to determine goal completion. Use the investor's Profile ID (W1-W15, B1-B15) to apply the appropriate tiered savings rate and then apply modifiers based on home ownership, borrowing status, dependents’ goal status, and spouse’s income when generating the **Guide for the Investor**.
- **Annual Adjustments**: Apply modifiers to the savings amount before annual adjustment (from the **Master for Annual Savings Adjustment Rates_Updated.markdown**). Round after the annual adjustment.
- **Customization**: Rates can be further adjusted based on individual circumstances (e.g., additional expenses) during investor consultations.
- **Tone Alignment**: Ensure communication aligns with the **Communication Framework for Investors**, using empowering language.
- **Validation**: Test calculations with sample incomes to ensure rates are realistic after applying modifiers and rounding.

## Conclusion
This updated master provides recommended savings rates for all 30 standard investor profiles. It derives dependents’ ages from their DOBs for accurate assessment of goal completion for savings rate modifiers and incorporates spouse’s income alongside other factors to create realistic savings rates. This structure ensures comprehensive coverage and alignment with the `Investor_Profiles_Master_Updated.markdown`.
